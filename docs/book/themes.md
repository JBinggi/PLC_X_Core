# themes

We have built a basic theme engine for onePlace.

You can switch the selected theme per user. So each user can use one of 
the supported themes of your onePlace Apps.

## the basic theme

onePlace Core is shipped with a default boostrap 4 theme.

## Use existing themes

We have existing themes for the most popular premium admin
templates we found. You can use one of these if you like, all you
have to do is to download the our theme and buy the underlying premium template
from themeforest.

Current themes are :

* [VUZE](https://github.com/OnePlc/oneplace-theme-vuze)
* Able Pro 8.0 (currently on private github repo)
 
## Create own theme

If you want to create your own theme, or integrate another premium template,
you can use our theme boilderplate, which gives you a quick start for creating
your own onePlace theme.

[Get it on github](https://github.com/OnePlc/oneplace-theme-boilerplate)

## Conclusion

onePlace can be themed. You can download several existing themes to use, and create
your own theme if you like.
